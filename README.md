# gmatools
tools and low level library for doing stuff with gmod addon files. code is not pretty, i wanted to keep the code as easy to write as possible.

i chose c because its perfect for this task. it stays out of my way so i can write code quickly, and it compiles fast so i can test fast.

right now i only have the header parser written and gmastat.c only works on unix like systems. gmastat.c is actually more like an example than anything complete.
